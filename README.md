## My Flask Boilerplate

Python's Flask microframework is an incredible choice for hackathon fanatics and small-scale developers alike, of which I am both. It's designed to be incredibly fast to set up, but I realized I still spent a marginal amount of time doing basic setup before I was ready to build my Flask app. So, this is my basic boilerplate that can be cloned and used whenever needed - especially at hackathons.

More details to come!
